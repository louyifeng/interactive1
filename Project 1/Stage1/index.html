    The New Typography [1923]
    <br><br>- Laszlo Moholy-Nagy

	<p>Typography is a tool of communication.
    <br><br>It must be communication in its most intense form.
    <br><br>The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms. 
    <br><br>Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation). 
    <br><br>This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication. 
    <br><br>Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions. 
    <br><br>Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics. 
    </p>
