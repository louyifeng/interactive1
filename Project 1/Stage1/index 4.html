    The New Typography [1923] - Laszlo Moholy-Nagy

	<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Typography
    <br>
    is a tool of communication.
    <br> 
    <br>
    <br>

    It
    <br>
    must be communication in its most intense form.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
  

    The emphasis
    <br>
    must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms. 
        
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    Our intellectual relationship to the world 

    <br>
    <br>
    is 
    <br>
    <br>
    individual-exact (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation). 
   
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This
    <br>
    is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Therefore priority: 
    <br>
    unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions. Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics.
